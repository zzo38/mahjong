This file describes the configuration format for defining mahjong rules.


=== Syntax ===

Comments start with ; and last until the end of the line.

A tile identifier starts with ' and is then one of the following:

* nM or nP or nS where n is 0 to 15 means one of the numbered tiles.
(Numbered tiles are normally 1 to 9, but this program allows you to add
tiles with other numbers as well.)

* E S W N for winds.

* C F P for dragons.

* XnF and XnS for flowers and seasons; n is a number 1 to 4.

* XnK and XnQ for emperors and empresses; n is a number 1 to 4.


=== Top-level definitions ===

(^tileflag ^tileflag...)
  Define a set of mutually exclusive tile flags. The first name in each
  block is the default within that set. Each set must contain at least two
  flags and at most sixteen flags.

(variable ...)
  Define a variable.

(HAND number)
  Define the hand size. This must be a number between 6 and 30 (inclusive)
  and cannot be exactly one more than a multiple of three. The default
  value is fourteen.

(PLAYERS number) or (PLAYERS players)
  Defines the players. This can either be a number of players (2, 3, or 4;
  the default is 4) or blocks defining the properties of each player (the
  number of blocks must be 2, 3, or 4).

(SHOW ...)
  Specifies to show some things which are not normally shown.

(TILES tiles)
  Defines the set of tiles to use. (The default is to use the full
  standard set of mahjong tiles without flowers, red fives, jokers, etc.)

(VISIBILITY ...)
  Define global visibility of the walls and of other player's tiles. See
  the below sections for details.


=== Set of tiles ===

This block can contain any of the clauses:

* PLUS: Adds the specified tiles to the set. The word PLUS can be omitted
for the first clause in the TILES block.

* MINUS: Removes the specified tiles from the set. If there are more than
one match, only as many as are specified are removed, and not all of them.
To remove all of them, use MINUS ALL instead.

* MINUS ALL: Removes all matching tiles from the set.

* TIMES: Multiplies the tiles in the set by the specified number, or by a
specified set of tile flags, or a combination of such.

* MODIFY: This clause must include a BY sub-clause; write the matching part
after MODIFY and the modifications to make after BY. This replaces whatever
is matched with those modified by the part after BY; the part after BY must
be a single tile flag, or a single () block with only tile flags.

* MODIFY ALL: Like MODIFY but modifies all matching tiles instead of only
one of each.

Within each clause, the lists for what can be matching can be in any of the
following formats. You can have multiples of them; the lists are
effectively multiplied together, taking all combinations of one of each.

* A plain number: That many multiple. However, it represents an arbitrary
match; if this is the only specification in a PLUS clause then it will be
a tile underspecification error, but it can be combined with others.

* The syntax (number TO number) or ('tile TO 'tile), which is the same as
writing all of those numbers in sequence explicitly, but is shorter.

* A list in () of tile qualities.

* A list in () of tile qualities and/or lists in (). The inside lists are
effectively combined into a single tile quality; this can be useful for
setting multiple groups of tile flags.

Tile qualities can be a tile (with the ' syntax), a number (representing
tiles with that number), one of the words MANZU PINZU SOUZU (representing
tiles with that suit), or a tile flag (representing tiles that have that
tile flag and not any of the others in the mutually exclusive set).

For example:  PLUS (1 TO 9) (MANZU PINZU SOUZU)  means all of the numbered
tiles from 1 to 9 in each suit. If you follow this by  4  or by  TIMES 4
then it will make four of each.

Note that tile specifications in a PLUS clause must specify at least the
matching identifier of the tile; a number or suit alone won't do. You do
not have to specify all tile flags, in which case the defaults are used.


=== Variables ===

A variable definition is either a global variable with @ at first, or a
local variable with % at first. Either way, the syntax is:
  (name team visibility type when value)

* Team: Optionally the word TEAM to share a variable by teams. This is not
valid for global variables.

* Visibility: Also optional; the default is that nobody can see it at all.
It may be PRIVATE to be visible to only the player that it belongs to,
FACING for the front to be visible by the player that it belongs to and for
the back to be visible to other players, PUBLIC to be visible to anyone, or
BACK for only the back to be visible to everyone. PRIVATE and FACING are
not valid for global variables.

* Type: The data type; if not specified, data of any scalar type can be
stored in this variable. Start with LIST or SET (either optionally followed
by OF) for a list or set type. The valid types are then: ANY, NUMBER, TILE,
PLAYER, DIRECTION, or BOOLEAN. The type must be specified if the visibility
is specified, but you can specify a type without visibility. Furthermore,
if the visibility is FACING or BACK, then the type must be TILE, LIST OF
TILE, or SET OF TILE.

* When: Specifies when this variable is reset. This is also optional. This
can be INIT (only at the beginning of a set of games and when mahjong_reset
is called), GAME (at the beginning of each game), ROUND (when the round
wind changes), DEAL (at the beginning of each deal), or NONREPEAT (at the
beginning of each deal that does not repeat the same wind of each players).

* Value: This is optional, but if specified then the time that it is reset
also must be specified. The value can always be NULL regardless of the
type, otherwise it can be one of the below according to the type, but for
a LIST or SET type only NULL is possible.

Values by types:

* BOOLEAN: TRUE or FALSE.

* NUMBER: Any numeric token.

* TILE: A tile. You may also specify zero or more tile flags afterward;
any that are not specified will use the default value.

If (when value) is not specified, then INIT NULL is the default setting.


=== Players ===

A player definition () block inside of a (PLAYERS) block can contain any
of the following clauses:

* TEAM number: Define the team that this player belongs to, from 0 to 3.
If not specified, then the first player is 0, the second is 1, etc.

Currently, there are no other clauses in the (PLAYERS) block.


=== Global visibility ===

This block can contain the visibility of any of the following:

* HAND: Other player's hands.

* WALL: The live wall.

* DEADWALL: The dead wall.

* KAN: Other player's closed kan.

* FLOWERS: Other player's declared flowers.

* DORA: Dora indicators.

* URADORA: Uradora indicators.

After each thing to specify the visibility of, you can specify one of
the following types of visibility:

* HIDDEN: They cannot be seen.

* CLOSED or BACK: The back of the tiles can be seen.

* OPEN or FRONT: The front of the tiles can be seen.

* MIXED: Only valid for KAN, and means that two tiles will be open and
two tiles will be closed. (Normally this does not hide any additional
information, although it may do so if jokers are allowed in closed quads.)

* STACKED: This must be followed by CLOSED or OPEN (or the synonyms BACK
or FRONT). This is only valid for WALL and DEADWALL, and means that the
bottom tile is hidden but the top is visible.

The defaults are:
  HAND CLOSED
  WALL HIDDEN
  DEADWALL HIDDEN
  KAN MIXED
  FLOWERS OPEN
  DORA OPEN
  URADORA HIDDEN


=== Show ===

The SHOW block can contain any of:

* DEALT: Reveal the contents of each player's initially dealt hand.

* TENPAI: Show if each player tenpai.

* TSUMOGIRI: Allows players to tell if an opponent discarded the card just
drawn or a card that was already in their hand from before.
